Lesson 3a
1) Your friend comes to you with an idea to start a business walking dogs for busy professionals. Assume he is correct that there is a market for this: there are a large number of busy people with pets that would be willing to pay a decent amount of money for dog walking services for their pet. Your friend assures you that this business will generate significant (economic) profits for a long time. What do you think? Use concepts from class in your answer. (17 points)
While your friend is correct that a viable market for dog walking exists and that the business can generate accounting profits (where revenue exceeds explicit costs), it is highly unlikely that it will generate significant economic profits for a long time. The primary reason for this is the market structure, which closely resembles perfect competition due to the extremely low barriers to entry.
Here's a breakdown using concepts from the course:
Low Barriers to Entry: This is the most critical factor. The dog walking industry requires minimal capital investment (leashes, waste bags), no specialized licenses or patents, and no significant economies of scale. Almost anyone can enter the market quickly and easily.
Attraction of Economic Profits: If your friend starts the business and is successful in earning high economic profits (profits above and beyond the opportunity cost of his time and investment), these profits will act as a signal to others.
Influx of Competition: New entrepreneurs will see the success and enter the market, offering their own dog walking services. Because the barriers to entry are so low, this influx of new competitors will happen rapidly.
Increased Supply and Price Competition: As more dog walkers enter the market, the supply of the service increases. This heightened competition will put downward pressure on the price customers are willing to pay. To win clients, new entrants and existing businesses will compete on price.
Long-Run Equilibrium: This process will continue until the price for dog walking is driven down to a point where firms are only earning a "normal profit," which corresponds to zero economic profit. At this point, revenue is just enough to cover all explicit costs (supplies, marketing) and implicit costs (the owner's opportunity cost). There is no longer an incentive for new firms to enter, and the market reaches a long-run equilibrium.
In conclusion, I would advise your friend that while dog walking can be a sound business venture for earning a living (accounting profit), the expectation of sustained, significant economic profits is unrealistic. The competitive dynamics of an industry with such low barriers to entry will almost certainly erode those excess profits over time as new competitors emerge.
2) Using Porter's 5 Factors framework, discuss the profitability of the hotel industry in a geographic market of your choosing (perhaps the market in which you live?). (17 points)
Analysis of the hotel industry in a major metropolitan market (e.g., New York, Chicago, Atlanta) using Porter's Five Forces reveals an industry with intense competition and consistent pressure on profitability.
Intensity of Rivalry Among Existing Competitors (HIGH):
The industry is characterized by a high number of competitors in any given city, from large chains (Marriott, Hilton) to smaller boutique hotels.
Hotels have a high-fixed-cost structure (property, maintenance, staff) and a low marginal cost for an additional guest in an empty room. This creates intense pressure to cut prices to increase occupancy rates.
The service is perishable; an unsold room for a night represents revenue that is lost forever. This perishability fuels price competition.
While firms attempt to differentiate through branding, loyalty programs, and amenities, price remains a primary competitive weapon, especially for attracting price-sensitive travelers.
Threat of Substitute Products or Services (HIGH):
The most significant substitute threat comes from the short-term rental market, dominated by platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo. These services offer a different value proposition (e.g., more space, kitchens, "local experience") and often at a lower price point, directly competing for both leisure and business travelers.
Other substitutes include extended-stay hotels, corporate housing, and simply staying with friends or relatives. For business travel, video conferencing technology can act as a substitute for the trip itself.
Bargaining Power of Buyers (HIGH):
Buyers (travelers) have significant power due to the price transparency provided by Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like Expedia, Booking.com, and Kayak. These platforms allow customers to easily compare prices across hundreds of hotels with a few clicks, making them highly price-sensitive.
Large corporate clients who book rooms in bulk have immense bargaining power and can negotiate substantial discounts.
While loyalty programs are a strategy to reduce buyer power by creating switching costs, the ease of comparison for non-loyal customers keeps their overall power high.
Bargaining Power of Suppliers (MODERATE):
The primary suppliers are labor (housekeeping, front desk, etc.), utility companies, and food & beverage providers. Labor, especially if unionized, can have significant bargaining power and represents a major cost center.
OTAs can also be viewed as powerful suppliers of customers (or distributors), and they exert their power by charging high commission fees (often 15-25%) on bookings, which directly reduces a hotel's profitability.
Suppliers of other goods like linens and food are often numerous and sell commodity-like products, giving them low bargaining power.
Threat of New Entrants (MODERATE):
The threat from entirely new companies is relatively low due to high barriers to entry, including the immense capital cost of purchasing and developing property, as well as navigating zoning laws and regulations.
However, the threat of entry from existing hotel chains expanding into the market is much higher. A company like Hyatt can leverage its brand recognition, operational expertise, and access to capital to build a new hotel, making the market perpetually competitive.
Overall Conclusion: The Five Forces analysis indicates that the hotel industry is structurally challenging. With high rivalry, powerful buyers, and a strong threat from substitutes, firms are in a constant battle to maintain occupancy and pricing power. Profitability is possible through strong brand management, operational efficiency, and differentiation, but the underlying industry structure creates significant downward pressure on profits.
Lesson 3b
3) In class, so far we have discussed (sometimes very briefly!) three of the four classic market structures: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, and monopoly. In which one would you expect to see the most advertising? Why? (17 points)
You would expect to see the most advertising in a market structure of MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION.
Here is the reasoning based on the incentives within each market structure:
Perfect Competition: In this structure, firms have virtually zero incentive to advertise. The product is homogeneous (e.g., a bushel of wheat is the same regardless of the farmer). Since all products are identical, there is no brand or feature to differentiate through advertising. Furthermore, each firm is a "price taker" and can sell all it wants at the prevailing market price. Advertising would simply be an added cost with no corresponding benefit in revenue or price premium.
Monopoly: A monopolist is the sole seller in a market, so it has no direct competitors. Therefore, it does not need to advertise to steal customers from rivals. A monopolist might engage in some advertising, but its purpose is different. It may advertise to increase the overall demand for the product category itself (e.g., the De Beers campaign "A Diamond is Forever") or for public relations purposes to maintain a positive image and potentially stave off government regulation. The level of advertising is typically much lower than in a competitive environment.
Monopolistic Competition: This market structure is defined by two key characteristics: many firms competing, and product differentiation. Firms sell products that are similar but not identical (e.g., restaurants, clothing brands, hair salons). Advertising is the primary tool used to compete in this environment. The goal of advertising here is to:
Emphasize Product Differentiation: To inform and persuade consumers that their product is different and superior to the competition.
Build Brand Loyalty: To create a loyal customer base that is less sensitive to price changes from competitors.
Increase Market Power: Successful advertising can make the demand for a firm's product more inelastic, allowing the firm to charge a higher price without losing all of its customers.
In summary, advertising is the lifeblood of monopolistic competition because it is the main mechanism through which firms create and sustain the product differentiation that defines the market.
4) You are in business making and selling very high quality cosmetics to customers in your capital city. Your products have a very good reputation and you are able to charge a high price, despite the relatively low production costs. One of your partners points out the fact that many potential customers exist out in the suburbs (about one hour away by car) and while unwilling to pay full price, they would be willing to pay price higher than the cost of production. She suggests that you could earn additional profits by selling to them at a lower price and that maybe a price discrimination scheme might be a good idea by setting up a retail shop in the suburbs with lower prices. Comment on the likelihood of this idea generating additional profits. (17 points)
While the partner's idea to use a price discrimination scheme is theoretically sound for increasing profits, it is highly unlikely to succeed in this specific situation because the company cannot prevent arbitrage. The failure to prevent arbitrage would not only stop the scheme from generating additional profits but could also significantly erode the profits currently being made in the high-priced city market.
For a price discrimination scheme to be successful, three conditions must be met:
Firm Must Have Market Power: The firm must be able to set its price. Your business has a "very good reputation and you are able to charge a high price," so this condition is met.
Ability to Segment Customers: The firm must be able to identify and separate groups of customers based on their willingness to pay. Your partner has successfully identified two segments: the high-willingness-to-pay city customers and the lower-willingness-to-pay suburban customers. This condition is also met.
Prevention of Arbitrage: The firm must be able to prevent customers who buy at the lower price from reselling the product to customers in the high-price segment. This is the critical point of failure.
Why Arbitrage Cannot Be Prevented Here:
Nature of the Product: Cosmetics are physical, durable, and easily transportable goods.
Geographic Proximity: The suburbs are only "one hour away by car." This is not a significant barrier to travel for a motivated consumer or reseller.
As a result, two things would likely happen:
Cannibalization: Your high-paying city customers would quickly learn of the lower prices in the suburbs. Many would simply drive the hour to the suburban shop to purchase the exact same product at a discount, directly cannibalizing your high-margin sales.
Reselling: Enterprising individuals could buy your cosmetics in bulk at the low suburban price and then resell them online or in the city for a price that is lower than your official city price but still high enough to make a profit. This would create a gray market that directly competes with your city store, forcing you to lower your prices there to compete.
In conclusion, the inability to prevent arbitrage makes this price discrimination scheme unworkable. Instead of capturing new profits from the suburbs, the company would likely see its high-price structure in the city collapse, leading to an overall decrease in profitability.
Lesson 3c
5) You operate a small business giving tours... Predict what will happen if you will "play this game” only once. Does your answer change if you both play this game multiple times per year during busy weekends, for several years in a row? (16 points)
If the game is played only once, the predicted outcome is that both Tybee Tours and Island Adventures will choose to "Advertise and run a sale," resulting in a payoff of (70, 70) for each.
This is because running a sale is a dominant strategy for both players.
Your Perspective (Tybee Tours):
If your rival keeps their price at $25, your best move is to run a sale (130 > 100).
If your rival runs a sale, your best move is still to run a sale (70 > 60).
Regardless of your rival's action, you are always better off running the sale.
Your Rival's Perspective (Island Adventures):
The game is symmetrical. Their analysis is identical. They are always better off running a sale, regardless of what you do.
Since both players have a dominant strategy, the single-play Nash Equilibrium is for both to "Advertise and run a sale."
Yes, the answer changes dramatically if the game is played multiple times over several years.
In a repeated game, the most likely outcome is that both businesses will tacitly cooperate and "Keep price at 25," achieving the higher payoff of (100, 100) each time.
The reasoning is as follows:
The Shadow of the Future: In a repeated game, players are not just concerned with the payoff from the current weekend, but with the stream of future payoffs. The inferior outcome of (70, 70) is worse for both parties than the cooperative outcome of (100, 100).
Possibility of Retaliation: Players can adopt strategies based on their rival's past behavior. A common and effective strategy is "Tit-for-Tat." You would start by cooperating (Keep price at $25) and continue to do so as long as your rival does. If your rival ever defects by running a sale, you would retaliate by running a sale on the next holiday weekend and continue to do so until they return to the cooperative price.
Incentive Analysis: The short-term gain from defecting (earning 130 instead of 100, a gain of 30) is likely less than the long-term cost of the resulting price war. After defecting, the player would face a future of earning 70 each holiday instead of 100 (a loss of 30 per weekend). As long as the businesses value future profits, the long-term punishment outweighs the short-term gain, making cooperation the more rational and profitable strategy.
In summary, the logic of a one-shot game leads to a mutually destructive price war. The logic of a repeated game allows for tacit collusion and a mutually beneficial, high-price outcome.
6) In the market for housing in the downtown area of Becksberg... Solve the game for any Nash Equilibria using methods we learned in class. (16 points)
To find the Nash Equilibrium, we will analyze each player's best response to the other's possible actions. We can do this by underlining the best payoff for each player in each scenario.
1. Determine Builder #1's Best Responses: (We look down each column for Builder #1's highest payoff)
If Builder #2 chooses Fancy, Builder #1's possible payoffs are (20, 21, 24). The best choice is Basic with a payoff of 24.
If Builder #2 chooses Middle, Builder #1's possible payoffs are (21, 15, 16). The best choice is Fancy with a payoff of 21.
If Builder #2 chooses Basic, Builder #1's possible payoffs are (32, 20, 10). The best choice is Fancy with a payoff of 32.
2. Determine Builder #2's Best Responses: (We look across each row for Builder #2's highest payoff)
If Builder #1 chooses Fancy, Builder #2's possible payoffs are (25, 23, 24). The best choice is Fancy with a payoff of 25.
If Builder #1 chooses Middle, Builder #2's possible payoffs are (28, 15, 12). The best choice is Fancy with a payoff of 28.
If Builder #1 chooses Basic, Builder #2's possible payoffs are (32, 12, 10). The best choice is Fancy with a payoff of 32.
3. Identify the Nash Equilibrium:
A Nash Equilibrium exists in a cell where both payoffs are the best response (i.e., where both numbers would be underlined). We look for the outcome where neither player has a unilateral incentive to change their strategy.
Let's represent the matrix with the best responses identified:
Builder #2		
Builder #1	Fancy	Middle	Basic
Fancy	(20, 25)	(21, 23)	(32, 24)
Middle	(21, 28)	(15, 15)	(20, 12)
Basic	(24, 32)	(16, 12)	(10, 10)
The only cell in which both players are playing their best response simultaneously is when Builder #1 chooses Basic and Builder #2 chooses Fancy.
Therefore, the unique Nash Equilibrium for this game is:
Builder #1's Strategy: Basic
Builder #2's Strategy: Fancy
The resulting payoff is (24, 32).
